MSMeter
=======

MSMeter is an application for the Benchmarking of network attached storage for file-based editing and other media streaming use cases. Used with a number of generic client workstation, it can simulate a typical work load and access pattern representing a real working environment, like a newsroom or an editing suite. It is scriptable to automate long test sequences.
 
This tool can be used by broadcasters to test different storage solutions before they buy or before to put in production. It can also be used to fine tune parameters of the system to optimize the performances. Finally, it can be used as a research tool to understand the behavior of a storage system when the test conditions are being changed.
 
This was originally developed by the BBC. This version, developed at the EBU, add more granularity in the measurement to enable the evaluation the performance over short time windows. This, for instance, can test if a storage system can sustain real-time playback or recording. This version also introduces time stamping of measures to allow precise comparison of stream.
